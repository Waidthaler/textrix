     What is a site license?  A site license is an inexpensive way for more
     than one person to legally use one copy of a program on more than one
     computer at a time.  Site licenses are designed for companies, offices
     or workgroups where more than one person in the organization needs to
     use a product, but does not need additional manuals or disks.  Site
     licensing enables companies, departments, government agencies, etc.,
     to equip their personnel with the tools they need at a minimal cost.

     Here's the gist of how it works: the company purchasing a site license
     (the licensee) provides a single point of contact for shipping,
     technical support, upgrades, etc., and we (the licensor) provide a
     "master" of the disks, manual, and any other parts of the package.

     The following chart gives a breakdown of the cost of site licensing
     and how much you save per user.  For example, if you purchase a site
     license for 25 users, your cost will be $450.00, which is 28% less
     than the cost of 25 individual packages at $25 each ($623.75).

     modifications to the licensed program shall thereafter be licensed AS
     IS.

          6.2  The above warranty does not apply to the extent that any
     failure of the licensed program to perform as warranted is caused by

     documentation, or (2) modified by any person other than authorized
     Korenthal Associates personnel.

          6.3  LICENSOR MAKES AND LICENSEE RECEIVES NO OTHER WARRANTY OF

     for any claim or damage arising out of the use of the licensed program
     or otherwise related to this license shall be limited to direct
     damages which shall not exceed the license fee(s) which have been paid
     by Licensee to Korenthal Associates for the specific client project
     which is the subject of such claim or damage.

          7.2 IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE FOR
     ADDITIONAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS OR
     OTHER INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
     OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED PROGRAM, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS

          9.1  Neither this agreement nor any rights or obligations
     hereunder shall be assigned or otherwise transferred by Licensee

     representative of the parties.

          9.5  If any terms or provisions of this agreement shall be found
     to be illegal or unenforceable then, notwithstanding, this agreement
     shall remain in full force and effect and such term or provision shall
     be deemed stricken.

          9.6  No amendment of this agreement shall be effective unless it

     breach excused unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
     signed by the party claimed to have waived or consented.  Any consent
     by any party to or waiver of a breach by the other, whether express or
     implied, shall not constitute a consent to, waiver of or excuse for

     benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators, successors and
