     Copyright 1991 by Korenthal Associates, Inc.
     All Rights Reserved


     Introduction:
     -------------
     Babble!, a toy for people who love words.  This program babbles
     endlessly in an unlimited number of writing styles.  You control which
     styles are babbled, and you can mix different styles together while
     Babble! continues to generate its steady stream of more or less
     unintelligible prose.

     Babble! is fun to play with solo or as part of a group.  It comes with
     neat samples like Shakespeare, Dick and Jane, and Firesign Theater,
     and includes a plethora of special effects like Lisp, Hangman, and
     Subliminal, as well as the ever-surprising Pot Luck.  You can even
     import your own text samples!

     Babble! can be used as a creative tool for writers, an idea scrambler
     for brainstorming sessions, and even just as entertainment for people
     who love words!  Stan Kelly-Bootle of Computer Language (10/90) calls
     it:
          "More fun than showing your latest spreadsheets
           or those tired revolving beach balls."


     Installation:
     -------------
     Installation basically consists of copying the distribution files into
     their own subdirectory on a hard disk, or onto a floppy for floppy-
     based systems.  If you received Babble! in compressed form (i.e. as a
     single file called BAB200.ZIP), you can install and run Babble! using
     the following commands.  (Don't type the comments on the right!)

          MD \BABBLE               create subdirectory BABBLE
          PKUNZIP BAB200 \BABBLE   uncompress files into subdirectory
          CD \BABBLE               move to subdirectory
          BABBLE                   run Babble!

     If you're running Babble! on a monochrome graphics screen or a laptop,
     and you're having trouble reading the screen, try running the program
     with the -MONO option:

          BABBLE -MONO

     If you're *still* having trouble distinguishing bold characters from
     normal ones on the slider controls, first try adjusting the brightness
     and contrast knobs on your monitor.  Then, if that doesn't help, try
     running Babble! with the -MARK option:

          BABBLE -MARK

     For more detailed information on installing Babble!, please refer to
     Chapter 2 of the manual (the text file BABBLE.DOC).


     Printing the Documentation:
     ---------------------------
     When you install Babble!, you should check that none of the files are
     missing.  The complete list of files comprising the Babble! package is
     listed in the text file PACKING.LST.  

     All documentation files, including PACKING.LST, ORDER.FRM, and all
     files ending with the .DOC extension, can be printed using a special
     text printing program like 4PRINT (see note below), or by simply
     copying each file to PRN.  For example:

          COPY BABBLE.DOC PRN

     Note that these documentation files contain form feeds and IBM
     extended (box drawing) characters; if your printer can't handle these
     high-order characters, you can still view the document on your screen
     using the DOS TYPE command, Vern Buerg's venerable LIST program, or
     any other ASCII file viewer.

     Note: 4PRINT is an HP LaserJet/DeskJet utility offered by Korenthal
     Associates which prints four or more pages of text on one sheet of
     paper by printing on both sides in landscape mode.

     Version 4.0 of 4PRINT can fit *six* full pages of formatted text per
     sheet, or even *eight* pages of unformatted text, making it ideal for
     printing shareware docs, program listings, BBS or online service
     message threads, and other ASCII information.

     products by Korenthal Associates.


     Babble! is Shareware:
     ---------------------
     Babble! is being marketed as shareware.  Shareware gives users an
     opportunity to evaluate a program before buying it.  If you enjoy
     Babble! and wish to continue using it after a two-week trial period,
     you must order the registered version.  You'll receive the full retail
     package including a printed manual, nifty keyboard template, and many
     more writing samples to enhance your enjoyment of the program.

     benefits of becoming a registered user.
