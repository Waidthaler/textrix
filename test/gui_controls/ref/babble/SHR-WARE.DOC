     ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
     Some Definitions:
     ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     You've probably heard the terms "public domain", "freeware",
     "shareware", and others like them.  Your favorite BBS or disk vendor
     probably has many programs described by one or more of these words. 
     There's a lot of confusion about and between these terms, but they
     actually have specific meanings and implications.  Once you understand
     them, you will have a much easier time navigating the maze of programs
     available to you, and understanding what your obligations are, or
     aren't, with each type of program.

     Let's start with some basic definitions.

     "Public domain" has a very specific legal meaning.  It means that the
     creator of a work (in this case, a piece of software), who had legal
     ownership of that work, has given up ownership and dedicated the work
     "to the public domain".  Once something is in the public domain,
     anyone can use it in any way they choose, and the author has no
     control over the use and cannot demand payment for it.  

     If you find a program which the author has explicitly put into the
     public domain, you are free to use it however you see fit without
     paying for the right to use it.  But use care - due to the confusion
     over the meaning of the words, programs are often described by others
     as being "public domain" when, in fact, they are shareware or free,
     copyrighted software.  To be sure a program is public domain, you
     should look for an explicit statement from the author to that effect.

     "Copyrighted" is the opposite of public domain.  A copyrighted program
     is one where the author has asserted his or her legal right to control
     the program's use and distribution by placing the legally required
     copyright notices in the program and documentation.  The law gives
     copyright owners broad rights to restrict how their work is distri-
     buted, and provides for penalties for those who violate these restric-
     tions.  When you find a program which is copyrighted, you must use it
     in accordance with the copyright owner's restrictions on distribution
     and payment.  Usually, these are clearly stated in the program docu-
     mentation.  

     Maintaining a copyright does not necessarily imply charging a fee, so
     it is perfectly possible and legal to have copyrighted programs which
     are distributed free of charge.  The fact that a program is free,
     however, does not mean it is in the public domain - though this is a
     common confusion.

     "Shareware" is copyrighted software which is distributed by authors
     through bulletin boards, on-line services, disk vendors, and copies
     passed among friends.  It is commercial software which you are allowed

     to try out before you pay for it.  This makes shareware the ultimate
     in money back guarantees.


     ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
     The Shareware Concept:
     ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     Most money back guarantees work like this: you pay for the product and
     then have some period of time to try it out and see whether or not you
     like it.  If you don't like it, or find it doesn't do what you need,
     you return it (undamaged) and at some point - which might take months
     - you get your money back.  Some software companies won't even let you
     try their product!  In order to qualify for a refund, the diskette
     envelope must have an unbroken seal.  With these "licensing" agree-
     ments, you only qualify for your money back if you haven't tried the
     product.  How absurd!

     Shareware is very different.  With shareware, you get to try it for a
     limited time, without spending a penny.  You are able to try it on
     your own system(s), and in your own special work environment.  If you
     decide not to continue using it, you throw it away and forget all
     about it.  No paperwork, phone calls, or correspondence to waste your
     valuable time.  If you do continue using it, then - and only then - do
     you pay for it.

     Shareware is a distribution method, NOT a type of software.  Shareware
     is produced by accomplished programmers, just like retail software. 
     There is good shareware and bad shareware, just as there is good and
     bad retail software.  The primary difference between shareware and
     retail software is that with shareware you know if it's good or bad
     BEFORE you pay for it.  

     As a software user, you benefit because you get to try the software
     and determine whether it meets your needs before you pay for it, and
     authors benefit because they are able to get their products into your
     hands without the hundreds of thousands of dollars in expenses it
     takes to lauch a traditional retail software product.  There are many
     programs on the market today which would never have become available
     without the shareware marketing method.

     The shareware system and the continued availability of quality share-
     ware products depend on your willingness to register and pay for the
     shareware you use.  It's the registration fees you pay that allow us
     to support and continue to develop our products.

     Please show your support for shareware by registering those programs
     you actually use and by passing them on to others.

     Shareware is kept alive by YOUR support!

     ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
     The Virus Problem:
     ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     We've all heard the horror stories about computer viruses. 
     Unfortunately, we have also heard lots of conflicting statistics and
     opinions.  When it comes to the virus problem, there is a lot of
     confusion among users and even developers.

     The sad truth is that some unscrupulous publishers of anti-virus
     products are using half-truths, over-dramatizations, and outright
     fabrication to promote sales of their products.  They delight in
     manipulating statistics to support their marketing efforts.  While not
     illegal, these snake-oil tactics are certainly not ethical.

     To make matters worse, the media has frequently promoted the misinfor-
     mation promulgated by these unscrupulous individuals rather than the
     straight facts.  While the misinformation may be more interesting than
     the actual facts, the media is not doing the computer industry any
     favors by spreading inaccurate information.  To be fair, many news-
     papers, magazines, and news networks are beginning to realize which
     "virus experts" are reliable and which "experts" say whatever is in
     their own best interest.

     One of the most interesting myths that has been promulgated by these
     snake-oil salesmen is that BBS's (bulletin board systems) and share-
     ware programs are a major source of virus infections.  Some corpora-
     tions are now afraid of shareware and BBS activity because of this
     misinformation.

     In the October 11, 1988 issue of PC Magazine, publisher Bill
     Machrone's editorial was entitled "Shareware or Scareware?".  In his
     article, Bill Machrone points out, "The truth is that all major
     viruses to date were transmitted by commercial [retail] packages and
     private mail systems."  That sounds a little different than the claims
     being made by less knowledgeable journalists!

     Let's consider for a moment, the distribution differences between
     retail software and shareware.  Company XYZ releases a new version of
     its retail software product.  At the same time that company XYZ ships
     tens of thousands of copies to its retail distribution channels, it
     also ships 30,000 updates to loyal users.  Most of those loyal users
     will receive the update within a few days of each other.  This can be
     a big problem if the update happened to be infected with a virus.

     "Not likely", you say?  It has already happened!  Several times! 
     There have been seventeen (17) major incidents of virus and trojan
     horse problems in retail software.  Some of these incidents affected
     tens of thousands of users.



     Shareware and the ASP                                      Page 4 of 7


     Korenthal Associates, Inc.                                SHR-WARE.DOC


     What about shareware?  To date, there has been one case of a shareware
     author shipping an infected product.  The virus was detected by the
     disk vendors and the problem was corrected immediately.  No users were
     infected.

     "But it makes sense that programs which are passed around have a
     greater chance of virus infections, doesn't it?"  Think about it.  Who
     has the most to lose if viruses were spread by BBS's and shareware
     programs?  The BBS operators, shareware disk vendors and the shareware
     authors, of course.  Because of this, reputable BBS operators, disk
     vendors and shareware authors are very careful with the programs they
     handle.

     Think about it.  Hundreds (even thousands) of BBS operators and disk
     vendors are carefully examining the programs they receive and distri-
     bute.  Their business depends on it.  This means that any given
     shareware program can go through hundreds, even thousands of check-
     points where the program is carefully examined.  If a problem is found
     the word spreads incredibly fast.  News travels in the BBS community
     even faster than the proverbial small town gossip.  Programs have
     disappeared almost overnight as a result of this highly efficient
     communication network.

     If a shareware program has been around for a few months, it has been
     checked for viruses and trojan horses many more times than any retail
     software could hope to be checked.  Retail distributors don't check
     the disks they sell.  Even if the publisher checks their masters for
     viruses, and few do, that is still far less than the scrutiny to which
     shareware programs are subjected.

     Bill Machrone's article in PC Magazine goes on to say, "It's time to
     recognize that there's nothing to fear in shareware.  As a distribu-
     tion medium, it saves you money and helps you try out new genres of
     software with minimum risk."

     Does this mean that we should all start buying shareware instead of
     retail software?  Not at all (though few shareware authors would
     object).  Let's face it, more data has been lost to power failures,
     spilled cups of coffee, and plain old human error than all virii,
     trojan horses, and worms combined!  Accurate information and common
     sense (regular backups) are the best defenses against lost data.

     Sure, the virus problem is real.  Virii exist.  But shunning shareware
     is not the answer.  Shareware and BBSs are, quite simply, NOT a major
     source of virus infections!

     Don't let fear stop you from saving money on software.  Don't let
     fear prevent you from trying some of the best software available. 
     Shareware is an important market for software.  Take advantage of it. 
     You'll be glad you did!

     ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
     The Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP): 
     ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

     In the early days of shareware, there were no real standards.  Inde-
     pendent authors had no efficient way to learn from each other, or to
     work together to improve the overall image of shareware.  There was no
     system in place to ensure that users were treated fairly and profes-
     sionally.  There was no way for users to find an address for an author
     who had moved.  In short, the shareware community was disorganized and
     each author did things the way he or she thought was best.  It was
     clear that if shareware was ever to become a viable and respected
     marketing alternative, there had to be some standardization.  There
     had to be some guidelines to best serve the users.

     In 1987 a handful of shareware authors founded the Association of
     Shareware Professionals (ASP).  In forming this industry association,
     these shareware authors had several primary goals in mind, including:

       o  To inform users about shareware programs, and about shareware as
          a method of distributing and marketing software.

       o  To foster a high degree of professionalism among shareware
          authors by setting programming, marketing, and support standards
          for ASP members to follow.

       o  To encourage broader distribution of shareware through user
          groups and disk dealers who agree to identify and explain the
          nature of shareware.

       o  To assist members in marketing their software.

       o  To provide a forum through which ASP members may communicate,
          share ideas, and learn from each other.

     The newly formed Association of Shareware Professionals worked
     together to draft a code of ethics for all present and future members. 
     This code of ethics included several requirements that soon became
     very popular among users (customers), including:

       o  A member's program (evaluation version) could not be limited
          (crippled) in any way.  In the true spirit of Try-Before-You-Buy,
          users must be able to evaluate all the features in a program
          before paying the registration fee.

       o  Members must respond to every registration.  At the very least
          they must send a receipt for the payment.

       o  Members must provide technical support for their products for at
          least 90 days from the date of registration.

     A new system was put in place to help ensure that users were treated
     fairly and professionally.  If a user was unable to resolve a problem
     with a member author then the user could contact the ASP Ombudsman
     with their complaint.  The Ombudsman would then try to help resolve
     the dispute.  For more complete details regarding the Ombudsman,
     please refer to the "ASP Ombudsman Statement" below.

     As of November, 1990, the ASP had about 300 author members and almost
     200 vendor members, with new members joining every week.
