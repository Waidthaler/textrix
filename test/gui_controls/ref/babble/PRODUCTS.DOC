     Korenthal Associates has been producing top quality computer software
     since 1984, and has been a member of the Association of Shareware
     Professionals (ASP) since 1988.  Jim Korenthal is currently Vice
     President of the ASP.  KA's current product offerings include:


       o  4PRINT, an HP LaserJet/DeskJet utility which prints four or more
          pages of text on one sheet of paper by printing on both sides in
          landscape mode.  4PRINT allows programmers to view four pages of
          source code at a time, writers to read four pages of text, and
          spreadsheet and database users to print wide reports all the way
          across the page.

          Version 4.0 of 4PRINT can now print up to *four* columns of text
          per side, cramming *eight* or more pages of information on a
          single sheet of paper!  This new release also includes automatic
          line numbering, word wrap for printing text files exported from
          word processors, special indenting features for programmers,
          ability to print full-width Lotus spreadsheets, A4 paper support,
          optional removal of excess blank lines and page breaks, improved
          DeskJet support, and many other new features.

          4PRINT saves you money by using less paper than standard printing
          methods, and perhaps more importantly, its output takes up less
          shelf space.  This reduced paper usage also makes 4PRINT an
          *ecologically* sound investment. Another convenience is that
          while the LaserJet normally prints only 60 lines per page, 4PRINT
          can print a standard 66 lines on each of its "pages", making it
          indispensable for printing on-disk shareware manuals and other
          formatted ASCII documents.  [$49.95]

               "4PRINT is definitely worth adding to your printer toolbox."
                PC Magazine, First Looks, March 27, 1990

               "The result is a very neat-looking document that takes up
                only 25 per cent of the paper and space."
                InfoWorld, October 3, 1988.

               "4PRINT provides a simple, elegant solution encountered by
                many programmers and documentation writers."
                Computer Language, June 1988.


       o  Babble!, a toy for people who love words.  This program babbles
          endlessly in an unlimited number of writing styles.  *You*
          control which styles are babbled, and you can mix different
          styles together even as Babble! continues to generate its steady
          stream of more or less unintelligible prose.

          Babble! is fun to play with solo or as part of a group.  It comes
          with neat samples like Shakespeare, Dick and Jane, and Firesign
          Theater, and includes a plethora of special effects like Lisp,
          Hangman, and Subliminal, as well as the ever-surprising Pot Luck. 
          You can even import your own text samples!

          Babble! can be used as a creative tool for writers, an idea
          scrambler for brainstorming sessions, and even just as entertain-
          ment for people who love words!  [$25]

               "More fun than showing your latest spreadsheets or those
                tired revolving beach balls."
                Stan Kelly-Bootle, Computer Language, October 1990.


       o  Enhanced TapMark and TapMail (previously called TAPLEX), util-
          ities which facilitate use of the CompuServe navigation program
          TAPCIS.  Enhanced TapMark, which is considered indispensable by
          most TAPCIS users, keeps track of which message threads you are
          following in a forum, and watches out for new messages that might
          be of interest.  TapMail organizes your Email correspondence by
          sorting it into different files based on the name of the
          correspondent.  [$25 each, or both for $39.95]
